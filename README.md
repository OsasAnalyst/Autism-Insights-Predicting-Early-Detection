## **Model Development**

### **Overview**
The goal of this project was to develop a robust predictive model to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a comprehensive dataset of assessments, demographic data, and behavioral indicators. By accurately identifying ASD, this model will enable healthcare providers to implement timely interventions, significantly improving long-term outcomes for affected individuals and reducing the overall burden on the healthcare system.

To achieve this, several machine learning algorithms were tested, and the best-performing model was fine-tuned and evaluated rigorously.

### **Model Training**

Three machine learning models were selected for initial training and evaluation:  
1. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
3. **XGBoost Classifier**

These models were chosen for their ability to handle classification tasks effectively. A **Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation** was employed to ensure that each fold preserved the class distribution, improving the reliability and generalizability of model evaluations.

#### **Cross-Validation Results**
The average cross-validation accuracy for each model was as follows:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: 86%
- **Random Forest Classifier**: 92%
- **XGBoost Classifier**: 91%

The **Random Forest Classifier** emerged as the top-performing model, showcasing its ability to:
- Minimize overfitting through ensemble learning.
- Capture complex patterns in the data using multiple decision trees.
- Deliver consistent results across all folds of the validation set.

### **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**

To further optimize the performance of the Random Forest Classifier, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using **RandomizedSearchCV**. This process systematically explored a predefined range of hyperparameters to identify the best combination for maximum accuracy.

#### **Optimal Hyperparameters**
The best configuration for the Random Forest model was:
- **Bootstrap**: False  
- **Max Depth**: 20  
- **Number of Estimators**: 50  

Hyperparameter tuning improved the cross-validation accuracy of the Random Forest model to **93%**, demonstrating its reliability for early autism detection.

    macro avg       0.74      0.75      0.75       160
    weighted avg       0.82      0.82      0.82       160
    ```

#### **Interpretation of Results**
- **Class 0 (Non-ASD)**: The model performed exceptionally well in predicting non-ASD cases, achieving a precision of 89% and recall of 87%.  
- **Class 1 (ASD)**: While the precision (59%) and recall (64%) for ASD cases are lower, they are notable given the dataset's imbalance. The F1-score of 61% highlights the need for further improvements in detecting ASD cases without sacrificing overall performance.  
- **Balanced Metrics**: The weighted averages indicate a strong overall performance.

## **Limitations of Work**

Despite the promising results, there are several limitations to this work that must be acknowledged:

1. **Feature Limitations**:  
   - The dataset primarily relied on behavioral and demographic data, which, while important, may miss other significant indicators such as genetic or neurological markers.  
   - The features included in the dataset may not be exhaustive or universally applicable across diverse populations.

2. **Generalization to Diverse Populations**:  
   - The model was trained on a specific dataset that may not fully represent all ethnicities, geographies, or socioeconomic groups. This could limit its applicability in global or underserved contexts.

3. **Lack of Real-World Validation**:  
   - The model has not been tested on real-world clinical data. Its performance in a controlled dataset may not fully translate to real-world applications where noise, missing data, and variability are higher.

4. **Static Model**:  
   - The current model is static and does not incorporate new data automatically. In real-world scenarios, predictive models must adapt to changing patterns, requiring a robust update mechanism.
